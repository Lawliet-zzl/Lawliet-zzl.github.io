I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Data Science Lab, Macquaire University, led by [Prof. Longbing Cao](https://datasciences.org/cao/). I received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Technology Sydney in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Longbing Cao](https://datasciences.org/cao/) and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~psyu/). Prior to that, I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, China, in 2016 and 2018, respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn).


**Research**

My current research focuses on generalization analysis, out-of-distribution detection, and distribution discrepancy estimation.
