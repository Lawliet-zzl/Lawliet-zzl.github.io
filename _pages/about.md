I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Data Science Lab, Macquaire University, led by [Prof. Longbong Cao]([https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn](https://datasciences.org/cao/)). I received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Technology Sydney in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Longbong Cao]([https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn](https://datasciences.org/cao/)) and [Prof. Philip.S Yu]([https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~psyu/)). Prior to that, he received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, China, in 2016
and 2018, respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn).


**Research**
My current research focuses on generalization analysis, out-of-distribution detection, and distribution discrepancy estimation.
