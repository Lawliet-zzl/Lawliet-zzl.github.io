Zhilin Zhao is currently an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU). After earning his Ph.D. degree from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2022, where he was co-supervised by [Prof. Longbing Cao](https://datasciences.org/cao/) and [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~psyu/), he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at UTS for a year and then continued his postdoctoral research at Macquarie University. Prior to his doctoral studies, he completed his B.E. and M.E. degrees at the School of Data and Computer Science, SYSU, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](https://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn). He was honored with the Outstanding Undergraduate Student of SYSU Award in 2016 and the Outstanding Graduate Student of Canton Award in 2018.

**Research**

My current research focuses on generalization analysis, out-of-distribution detection, and distribution discrepancy estimation.
